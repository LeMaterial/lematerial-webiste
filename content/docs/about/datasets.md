As part of LeMaterial, we released and will maintain different datasets, unifying and standardizing data from existing databases:

- `LeMat-Bulk`: released in December 2024, it unifies data from Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD into a high-quality resource with consistent and systematic properties (6,7M entries, 7 material properties)
  - [https://huggingface.co/datasets/LeMaterial/LeMat-Bulk](https://huggingface.co/datasets/LeMaterial/LeMat-Bulk)

- `LeMat-BulkUnique`: released in December 2024, this dataset provides de-duplicated material using our structure fingerprint algorithm. It is available in 3 subsets, for PBE, PBESol, and SCAN functionals.
